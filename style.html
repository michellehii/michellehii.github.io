        <p>I enjoy learning and exploring new forms of art. I am currently a high school freshmen and is aspiring to attend Princeton University in the future. I have been volunteering at local church communities and I participate in forms of art throughout my high school. My interests include art and music as well as biology and life sciences.On my free time, I love exploring the outdoors as well as hiking.</p>
